# The Tracker

## Show social & ecom numbers

### Flexible counter to display any of your data supported by a tolta.co tracker on a TidByt.

Twitter, YouTube, Ghost, Chart Mogul, Gumroad, Paddle, and Clubhouse.

Instagram is not working on tolta.co and has not been for some time. Sorry! Nothing I can do about that.

I still added the instagram icon as a tease because it looks great.

## Flexible layout, number formatting, colors, icons, and font

Happy to add any additonal icons! Most I am using are 16px, very few are 12px. Feel free to send me your desired icon in PNG or Base64.

Twitter asks to not use their icon in any settings smaller than 16px, so a smaller Twitter icon is off the table.

If you want to find your own icon, I suggest icons8.com's Tiny Color collection: https://icons8.com/icons/tiny-color.

These are all 16px pixel perfect icons.

Happy to add addional colors too! Send me a hex color code, a color name of your choosing, and a lymrick please :)
