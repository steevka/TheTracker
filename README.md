Instagram has not been working on tolta.co for some time. Sorry! Nothing I can do about that. The logo looks sexy so I kept it.

Note that tolta.co refreshes data every 30 minutes.

## Flexible layout, number formatting, colors, icons, and font

Happy to add any additonal icons! Most I am using are 16px, very few are 12px. Feel free to send me your desired icon in PNG or Base64.

Twitter politely asks to not use their icon in any setting smaller than 16px, so a smaller Twitter icon is off the table.

If you want to find your own icon, I suggest icons8.com's Tiny Color collection: https://icons8.com/icons/tiny-color. These are all 16px pixel perfect icons.

Happy to add addional colors too! Send me a hex color code, a color name of your choosing, and a lymrick please :)
